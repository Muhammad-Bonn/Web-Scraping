# Web Scraping and EDA Projects
This repository contains Python Jupyter Notebooks that focus on Web Scraping and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
It includes projects that extract structured data from websites using tools like requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, followed by data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
Special emphasis is placed on football-related datasets, uncovering insights, trends, and meaningful patterns through analysis.
